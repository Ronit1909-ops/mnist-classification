<h1>mnist-classification</h1> 
<p>
  This project uses a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset. The goal is to build an image classification model that can correctly identify digits from 0 to 9 based on pixel values of 28x28 grayscale images.

<h3>
  Project Overview
</h3>

<p>
  This project demonstrates how to train a neural network to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is 28x28 pixels, providing a dataset that is widely used as a benchmark in machine learning.
</p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>
  The MNIST dataset is pre-processed, containing:

Training data: 60,000 images
Testing data: 10,000 images
Classes: Digits from 0 to 9
Each image in the dataset is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image, and each pixel is represented by a single intensity value (0 to 255).
